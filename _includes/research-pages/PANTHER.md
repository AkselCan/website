Another project we are looking forward to implementing is building an autonomous drone. This project is based on previous work, PANTHER: Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner in Dynamic Environments. Currently, this project is still in its beginning stages of assembly, but future goals include implementing SLAM and path planning algorithms to autonomously navigate aerially.

Pictured below is the VOXL and power source that will be installed on Air Lab's drone.
