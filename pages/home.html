  <h1>AIROU Mission</h1>
  <p>
    Our mission is to design and build autonomous ground and aerial vehicles that can navigate safely in real
    environments.
    <br><br>

    Our intelligent agents can collaborate and interact with each other,
    creating a heterogenous team of vehicles that collaboratively or individually accomplish a variety of tasks such
    as:
    delivery, transportation system, weather forecast, search and rescue, and mapping. <br><br>
    Our projects spans broad aspects of robotics and AI, including but not limited to: <br><br>
    &#x2022; Machine Learning <br>
    &#x2022; Reinforcement Learning <br>
    &#x2022; Multi-agent Systems <br>
    &#x2022; Data Fusion <br>
    &#x2022; Localization and Mapping (SLAM) <br>
    &#x2022; Robust Control and Navigation <br>
    &#x2022; Autonomous Driving <br>
    &#x2022; Computer Vision. <br>

    <h2> Oct 2022 | New Lab Set Up in Carson B12 </h2>

    <p>AIROU's new lab has been successfully set up in Carson B12. This space will be used for testing and
      implementing various
      lab and research endeavors. Currently, our member Daniel Vargas has been working on assembling our drones and
      MUSHr racecars
      in the lab space.

    <h2> Oct 2022 | Oklahoma Transportation Research Day</h2>
    <p> Last October, our lab members Daniel Vargas, Yuki Zheng, and Tyler Roman were able to attend the
      Oklahoma Transportation Research Day. <br>

      Lab member, Daniel, presented his work on the implementation of localizing and mapping
      with advanced AI for autonomous navigation, and presented his MUSHr racecar project our lab is using
      to test our visual navigation and simulations.
      <br><br>
      Lab members, Yuki and Tyler, presented their poster exploring AIROU's
      project for collaborative multi-view perception for a safe, robust, and scalable autonomous driving system.
      Some topics covered include 3-D multi-object detection, sensor fusion, multi-object tracking,
      collaborative learning, localization, and mapping.
