        "description": "Our current project focuses on localization and mapping for autonomous navigation utilizing MUSHr hardware. We look forward to transferring this software from our assembled MUSHr racecar to future larger projects. Using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) on a simulation of the racecar and its surroundings, we plan on later implementing this software onto the physical car and testing it in the physical world. <br> Pictured on the right is our first assembled and operational MUSHr racecar. <br> Our next step is to implement a simulation using SLAM that allows the vehicle to gather data using the LiDAR and stereo camera installed on-board for accurate and consistent localization. Our goals is for our car to physically showcase fully autonomous navigation.",

This project is based on previous work, PANTHER: Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner in Dynamic Environments. Currently, this project is still in its beginning stages of assembly, but future goals include implementing SLAM and path planning algorithms to autonomously navigate aerially.<br>Pictured is the VOXL and power source that will be installed on Air Lab's drone.",

        "description": "The third project we are interested in involves implementing our software onto larger vehicles, such as a rover. Specifically, we are interested in utilizing hardware from the Clearpath Husky/Jackal and Trodden Robotics Rover.<br>Our goal is to autonomously navigate an environment, like the MUSHr racecars and drone projects, but with larger vehicles. Currently, we are only purchasing the parts and planning the assembly of the rover as we focus on the previously mentioned two projects first.",
